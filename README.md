# Reinforcement Algorithms in Competitive Environments
<b>Gabriele Prato, McGill University</b>

In the COMP767 course we've seen many reinforcement learning algorithms in different environments, but never in a competitive one.

In this notebook we will take a look at such environments and compare two algorithms, Sarsa and Q-learning, on them.

We will implement two environments of our own, not found in the class textbook [1] as well as the Sarsa and Q-learning alrgorithms [1].<br/>

The Sarsa algorithm can be found on page 138 and the Q-learning algorithm on page 140.
