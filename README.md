I have submitted two presentations this week. Each one is found in its own folder.

Here are their descriptions:

# Reinforcement Algorithms in Competitive Environments
<b>Gabriele Prato, McGill University</b>

In the COMP767 course we've seen many reinforcement learning algorithms in different environments, but never in a competitive one.

In this notebook we will take a look at such environments and compare two algorithms, Sarsa and Q-learning, on them.

We will implement two environments of our own, not found in the class textbook [1] as well as the Sarsa and Q-learning alrgorithms [1].<br/>


# Policy Iteration, Sarsa and Q-learning
<b>Gabriele Prato, McGill University</b>

In this notebook, we will try the Policy Iteration, Sarsa and Q-learning algorithms on the Jack's Car Rental problem described in the class textbook [1].

Example 4.2 and Exercice 4.5 will be implemented as well as the Policy Iteration, Sarsa and Q-learning algorithm.

Jack's Car Rental problem and the Policy Iteration algorithm can be found on page 87.
The Sarsa algorithm can be found on page 138 and the Q-learning algorithm on page 140.
